# Changelog

Dated entries for significant changes to the docs, scripts, or skill.

## 2026-05-19

Initial import. Project-aware pipeline complete with three user guides
(setup, workflows, upgrade), AI context doc in HTML+markdown, and canonical
scripts extracted to `/scripts`:

- `_pipeline_lib.sh` — shared functions for wrappers
- `concept.sh`, `generate.sh`, `print.sh` — pipeline stage entry points
- `clean_asset.py`, `prepare_for_print.py` — Blender helpers
- `migrate_assets.sh` — one-shot migration to project-aware layout
- `skill/SKILL.md` + `skill/scripts/update_manifest.py` — Claude Code skill

Repo bootstrapped with README, CONVENTIONS, and this changelog. Only the
setup guide (`docs/asset-pipeline-guide.html`) and AI context doc are
committed in this initial import; `asset-pipeline-workflows.html` and
`asset-pipeline-upgrade-guide.md` exist but were not uploaded to this
working directory yet.
